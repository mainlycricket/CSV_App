- This project generates a single `.sql` file (PostgreSQL database) for the provided `.csv` files in `./data` directory.
- It also generates a basic standalone CRUD API for these tables.
- I am currently focused on adding more features to the generated app.
- Complete documentation is available [here](https://mainlycricket.github.io/CSV_App/docs/getting-started)
